Simple Keylogger
This Python program implements a simple keylogger that records and logs keystrokes typed on the keyboard. It captures both regular characters and special keys, making it a valuable tool for monitoring keyboard activity.

Features
Efficient Logging: Captures keypresses in real-time and saves them into a text file.
User-Friendly: Easy-to-use interface suitable for users of all skill levels.
Customizable: Code can be modified to meet specific requirements or integrated into larger projects.
Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine:
bash

git clone https://github.com/your_username/simple-keylogger.git
Navigate to the project directory:
cd simple-keylogger
Run the Python script:
python keylogger.py
The keylogger will start recording keystrokes in real-time.
Press the 'ESC' key to stop the keylogger.
Retrieve the logged keystrokes from the generated "keylog.txt" file.
Ethical Considerations
Responsible Use: Ensure proper authorization before monitoring or logging keystrokes.
Privacy Rights: Respect privacy laws and regulations while using keyloggers for any purpose.
